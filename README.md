Algorithm, K-means, hierarchical clustering algorithm

Using k-means algorithm and Euclidean distance, cluster the data from A1 to A8. To start, consider A1, A4, A7 as the center of clusters.

A1=(2,10), A2=(2,5), A3=(8,4), A4=(5,8), A5=(7,5), A6=(6,4), A7=(1,2), A8=(4,9)

For questions A, B and C, calculate the algorithm only once and then answer accordingly.

a) Show the new clusters as sets.

b) show the center of the new clusters with a star.

c) Draw a 10x10 coordinate diagram and draw the new clusters and centers after the first calculation of the algorithm.

d) How many times (epoch) is needed for the algorithm to reach convergence? (You can draw only the coordinate diagram of each stage for convenience, otherwise show the clusters as a set.)
